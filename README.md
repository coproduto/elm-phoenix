# Elm-Phoenix

This is a skeleton project for building apps that serve [Elm](http://elm-lang.org) files using [the Phoenix framework](http://www.phoenixframework.org/)

You will need Phoenix and its dependencies installed in order to use this skeleton project.

To start your Phoenix app:

  * Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
  * Create and migrate your database with `mix ecto.create && mix ecto.migrate`
  * Install Node.js dependencies with `npm install`
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phoenix.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.

This project is heavily based on [this tutorial](https://medium.com/@diamondgfx/setting-up-elm-with-phoenix-be3a9f55bac2#.sp74sis09).
